# Rave
Full Stack MERN AI Image Generation App

## Technologies used
1. Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js together form the powerful MERN stack
2. Tailwind: The most popular CSS framework nowadays
3. OpenAI's DALL-E model: A deep learning model that generates images from text input
4. Cloudinary: A cloud-based image storage service

Note:
Since there are limited credits for using th OpenAI API, therefore there is a possiblity that the generat AI image functionality might stop working in the near future.
